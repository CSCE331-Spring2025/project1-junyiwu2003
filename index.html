                <p>I am currently taking the following courses this semester (Spring '25): </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>CSCE 331 - Foundation in Software Engineering</b>üíª.
                        A class that focuses on large scale software development, such as full stack web development.
                    </li>
                    <li><b>CSCE 469 - Advanced Computer Architecture</b>üíª.
                        The sequel to my Computer Architecture class that focuses on memory designs, piepine techniques, and parallel structures!
                    </li>
                    <li><b>ECEN 749 - Microprocessor Systems Design</b>üíª.
                        A class that focuses on microprocessors, covering topics 
                        such as 16/32-bit computer hardware, serial and parallel I/O interfacing, and memory circuits designed for no-wait-state operation.
                    </li>
                    <li><b>MATH 414 - Fourier Series and Wavelets</b>üíª.
                        A class that focuses on fourier transform with applications in data compressions and signal processing.
                    </li>
                </ul>

            <div class="description-box">
                <p>I chose this major because when I was little I was passionate about electronics. As you can see 
                from the courses above, many are about digital electronics and the architecture design align with my interests.
                These courses will provide me with a strong fundamental and will be essential for what I want to do in the near future.
