                    <h3>Career Aspirations: </h3>
                    <p>I chose this major because I have been passionate about electronics since childhood. The courses I've taken and currently taking
                        align perfectly with my interests and future career aspirations. 
                        After graduation, I plan to pursue a Master's degree, concentrating on computer architecture, hardware verification, and VLSI design. 
                        These areas are critical for building a strong foundation in Digital VLSI and Processor Architecture and will prepare me for a career in the semiconductor industry.

                    <h3> Hobbies: </h3>
                    <p> Aside from spending time in my room coding and learning about computers, I enjoy outdoor activities like walking in the park or hiking on trails. 
                        These activities not only help me build stamina and strength but also give me a chance to breathe fresh air and improve my mental health. 
                        Being outdoors creates a calming atmosphere that helps me relax, reduces stress, and promotes a sense of peace and balance.
                    </p>
                    <p> I also enjoy driving, as it provides a calming effect similar to walking. Moreover, driving allows me to clear my mind and focus on the road, offering a sense of freedom and an escape from negative thoughts. 
                        The scenic views I encounter while driving, combined with the solitude it provides, bring me a deep sense of peace and tranquility.
