            <h2>8 Bit Pipeline Adder</h2>
            <p class="text">In my ECEN 454 class, I designed an 8-bit pipelined adder as part of my labwork. Using Cadence Virtuoso, 
                I came up with transistor-level schematics and layouts for NOT, NAND, and XOR gates to build the adders.
                I also designed registers using D flip-flops and implemented a buffered H-tree clock distribution network 
                to ensure minimal clock skew across the sequential elements.
                Additionally, I leveraged Spectre simulation software to optimize performance by reducing parasitic capacitance, 
                which involved calibrating the sizes of each transistor in each design, and perform post layout simulations to 
                measure power consumption and progration delay.
                After Calibration, I integrated the calibrated adders and registers to construct the complete pipelined adder.
                Finally, I also performed post-layout simulations to validate functionality by running through tests.

            <h2>6502 Emulator</h2>
            <p class="text">
                I emulated the 6502 Emulator which used CISC aritecture. The main focus of this project was to expand my understanding of 
                lower level programming. The emulator was written in C++, and it fully repicates the 6502 instruction sets including 
                all the addressing modes. The emulator also correctly handles the execute, decode, and fetch cycle with the correct number of 
                execution cycles for each instructions. 
                The emulator supports various types of instructions, including arithmetic operations, jumps, stack manipulation, 
                and memory access, reflecting the full functionality of the original processor.Instructions are also validated using written testbench codes to ensure each instruction
                executes perfectly.

            <h2>Nand2Tetris</h2>
            <p class="text">
                During the last summer, I completed the Nand2Tetris part one course. In the course, I built a 16-bit CPU from the ground up using HDL.
                I started with the fundemental logic gates and progressed to more complex components like ALUs, registers, and program counter.
                I implemented modules for arithmetic operations, control flow, and memory access, eventually integrating them into a fully functional CPU.
                The CPU was tested by running high-level programs written in the Hack assembly language, ensuring accurate fetch, decode, and execute cycles.
